  This file contains predictive modeling using Super Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm.
* [Linear Regression - Automobile Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/lutfiaafifah/Supervised-Learning-for-Regression-Case/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20-%20Automobile%20Dataset.ipynb)\
  This file contains predictive modeling using Linear Regression algorithm.
* [Decision Tree Regressor - Automobile Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/lutfiaafifah/Supervised-Learning-for-Regression-Case/blob/master/Decision%20Tree%20Regressor%20-%20Automobile%20Dataset.ipynb)\
  This file contains predictive modeling using Decision Tree Regressor algorithm.
  
From these three algorithms used in this experiment, the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value was obtained when using Linear Regression algorithm. That means Linear Regressioon algorithm performed the best result for this dataset.
